# Extension patches

Some extensions occasionally need a local fix that isn't merged
upstream yet (a bug fix, a compatibility tweak, ...). Rather than
forking the extension, drop a patch here and it will be applied
automatically every time the extension is installed or updated (see
`patch_extension` in `entrypoint.sh`).

## Layout

```plain
patches/
└── <slug>/
    ├── 001-short-description.patch
    └── 002-another-fix.patch
```

- `<slug>` must match the extension's `install_extension` slug in
  `extensions.sh`.
- Patch files are applied in lexical order, hence the numeric prefix.
- An extension with no `patches/<slug>/` directory is left untouched.

## Creating a patch

Clone an extension's repo somewhere (e.g. `/tmp/<slug>`). From inside
the repo, make your fix, then:

```sh
git diff > ./patches/<slug>/001-short-description.patch
```

## Notes

- `install_extension` always leaves the extension at a clean upstream
  state (fresh clone, or `git reset --hard` on update), so patches
  are re-applied on every container start — no manual reapplication
  needed.
- If a patch fails to apply (e.g. upstream changed the patched lines),
  the container will fail to start with a `git apply` error; refresh
  the patch against the new upstream code.
